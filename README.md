## css grid postcard

What looks like paper is reconstructed via css grid. 
Each cell is a pixel. Paper, but computed.

I didn't want to do infinite scroll/feed. 

I wanted to do a postcard. Posts that occupy space. 
When they exceed it, they move sideways like fragments, like postcards laid next to each other. 

The page becomes an object.

The DOM is large (I know). If you’re looking for best practices, this is not that:)
