title: "TFLOPS Anxiety (because I definitely needed another one, superb)"
---
My brain is kinda analog trained (books, legal treatises, philosophy & blame eastern european culture, where if you can't hold an argument across three levels of recursion without contradicting yourself, you're an idiot). An entire culture that looks at diplomas & asks: 'ok, but what can you actually do?'. That kind of eval of how functional you are in the world:)))

"how many TFLOPS do you have?". Seriously?

Like any kid raised with straight A anxiety (thanks again, eastern european culture), I'm now doing the same circus with tech specs. TFLOPS anxiety. Should I add my Kobo too? I read papers on it and make annotations (at least I read papers), but TFLOPS:))))

Probably because I migrated like a little butterfly from legal exegesis to gradient descent debugging (not that different actually as how one thinks).

Obviously, when my brain runs simultaneously on multiple levels and everything reduces to one metric: do I or don't I have enough TFLOPS? Boom. The kid with 'did I read enough books?' transformed into the adult with 'do I have enough compute?'. Kinda same anxiety, different stack. Same shit, different units. 

Here we go again, dang.

And that's how I end up in this comedy of counting my TFLOPS. What matters is how many TFLOPS I have.
Well, I have TFLOPS. I have books read. I have K, V, Q and headaches. Somehow, in my head, they all contribute.

Obviously I do.
